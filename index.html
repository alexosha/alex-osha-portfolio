			<h1>Introduction</h1>
  			<p>Nearly my whole life has been in pursuit of mastery -- whether of speed, strength, and endurance, or of the guitar, the written word, or more intellectual pursuits.</p>
  			<p>From my four years at Bowdoin College to my time in the United States Air Force, I have always sought to make my own abilities beyond expectations laid out by others for me. My philosophy in this is that the more I can do, the better I can leave an impact in this world.</p>

  			<h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  			<p>I'm unabashedly from the South. Born in Georgia, raised in North Carolina, I've spent nearly all my life in the humid, hot rolling hills and mountains of the South. I learned hospitality, respect, honor, and duty in my youth, which have stuck with me to this day, qualities I quickly recognize in fellow Southerners and often find lacking in those from other locales.</p>
  			<p>I have spent several years now in Maine, attending Bowdoin College for most of them, which I consider "the South of the North" in that the individuals here are hardy, respectful, independent, and honorable.</p>

  			<h1>More About Me</h1>
  			<h4>What are your favorite hobbies?</h4>
    		<p>In line with my dedication to perfection and mastery, I have spent much of my spare time throughout the years working on my capabilties as a human. Such things I consider vital to survival and flourishing: swimming, running, weight-lifting, shooting firearms, hiking, camping, musical instruments, visual and performing arts. These are all skills I have spent many an hour building up, and it does not hurt that I enjoy them.</p>
  			<h4>What is your dream job?</h4>
  			<p>Two of my passions combined: teaching and firearms. I have long dreamed of being a firearms instructor: teaching responsible citizens how to defend themselves, their families, and their communities.</p>
  			<h4>What music have you been listening to lately?</h4>
  			<p>I have always gravitated to more energetic, passionate, perhaps even dark music. For instance, my current favorites are Tool, Nine Inch Nails, and Alice in Chains.</p>
